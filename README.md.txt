Capstone Project
Idea: Multiplayer online game analogy to codenames, but there will be cards with pictures along with cards with words.
MVP:
* A register/login page
* Settings page for admin when setting up a game
* lobby page to see who is ready to play
* actual game page with an action history on one side and a chat for players on another
Future Features:
* Implement a feature where the admin will be able to make custom game sets as a combo of cards with words and cards with pictures.
* records page: best Codemasters and etc.
* ratings for players
